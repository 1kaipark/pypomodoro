# pypomodoro
* a barebones pomodoro timer TUI made using `curses` in python.
* meant as a personal project. the entire script is barely more complex than some config files. 

## usage
* keep it a stack i'm too lazy to write this, just do python pomo.py -h
* hotkeys:
    * `p`: pauses timer
    * `S`: skips current timer
    * writing a quit hotkey is a pain in the ass so I just Ctrl+C it lmao
## todos:
* make it prettier
    * ASCII bonsaii tree art?
    * neofetch-style ascii rendering?
* refactor
